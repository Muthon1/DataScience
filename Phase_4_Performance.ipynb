        "# Concept of Natural Language Processing (NLP) chatbots with NLTK for text classification.\n",
        "Natural Language Processing is a field of Artificial Intelligence whose main focus is the interaction between computers and human languages. It aims at enabling machines to understand, interpret and generate human languages in a way that is useful and meaningful. NLP processes and analyzes large amounts of data by combining linguistics, computer science and machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "# How NLPs can be used to create Chatbots\n",
        "Natural Language Processing is critical for buiding chatbots since it enables the chatbot to understand and generate human language. NLP achieves this through a number of techniques including;\n",
        "\n",
        "i) Text Processing: text input by the user is cleaned and prepared for analysis through tasks such as tokenization, removing stop words, and lemmatization/stemming.\n",
        "\n",
        "ii) Intent recognition: NLP algorithms enable chatbots to understand the intent behind a user's input. For instance, if a user types \"I want to book a flight,\" the chatbot needs to recognize that the intent is to make a flight reservation.This is achieved through techniques such as text classification where the chatbot categorizes the input into predefined intent categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "iii) Entity Recognition: chatbot extracts relevant information from the text. For instance in a sample query \"I want to book a flight to Kisumu next week\", \"Kisumu\" is a location entity and \"next week\" is a time-related entity.\n",
        "\n",
        "iv) Response Generation: chatbot uses NLP to generate an appropriate response after processing the input. The response can be a predefined message or dynamically generated based on the user's request.\n",
        "\n",
        "# How NLTK can be used for Text Classification\n",
        "NLTK is a python library for working with human language data. It provides tools and resources for processing text, such as tokenizers, stemmers, part-of-speech taggers, among others. NLTK is useful for the text classification task in a number of ways including;\n",
        "\n",
        "i) Data Preparation: One requires a labeled dataset to train your classifier. NLTK can be used to preprocess this text data through tolenization, stemming/lemmatization and removing stop words.\n",
        "\n",
        "ii) Feature Extraction: For text classification, the text needs to be converted into a format that can be understood by machine learning algorithms. Tools like FreqDist(Frequency distributions) and TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) are provided by NLTK. FreqDist counts the number of occurences of words or n-grams (sequences of words) and creates features for classification. TF-IDF is used to represent text data numerically.\n",
        "\n",
        "iii) Training a Classifier: NLTK provides algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Decision Trees to train a text classifier once feature extraction is done.\n",
        "\n",
        "iv) Model evaluation: Once the classifier is trained, its performance is tested using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. NLTK provides tools to evaluate and validate the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "v) Prediction: After training, the classifier can be used to predict the category of new, unseen text.\n"
